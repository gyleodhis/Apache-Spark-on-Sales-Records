# Apache-Spark-on-Sales-Records
In this project I use Apache Spark 2.4 to analyze sales records containing some 1.5 million records.

## Technology
(The details on how to install the following softwares is regarded as outside the scope of this tutorial.

##### Apache Sparrk 2.4 and above
##### Python 3.5 and above
###### Jupyter Notebook
##### Pandas
##### Matplotlib

## Data
Due to Github space limitations quota, the original sales data has not been uploaded to this repository.
Am currently finding other ways on how to make the data available.
